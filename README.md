# SQL-Noir - Case-Files

This repository contains the workflow and solutions I have done to complete the currently available 6 Case Files at SQL Noir to practice SQL query workflows and tasks.
The aim of this project was to practice and deepen my knowledge of SQL databases, queries and joining together separate datatables while practicing deductive & analytical thinking to arrive at a solution to the game problems.


The repository contains the workflow based on notes and work taken for the following cases:

#Case 1 - The Vanishing Briefcase

#Case 2 - The Stolen Sound

#Case 3 - The Miami Marine Murder

#Case 4 - The Midnight Masquerade Murder

#Case 5 - The Silicon Sabotage

#Case 6 - The Vanishing Diamond
